Switch case :
Syntax :
switch(variable/expression){
   case value1:
    break;
   case value2:
    break;
   default:
    print statement
}
ex: 1. to check whether the number is positive or negative
 program:
        let num = prompt("Enter a number")
        switch(num){
            case num>0:
                document.write("number is positive")
                break;
            case num==0:
                document.write("number is zero")  
                break;
            case num<0 :
                document.write("number is negative")
                break;
            default:
                document.write("invalid input")          
        }
2. to check the day is weekday or weekend day
 program :
        let day = prompt("Enter a day of the week")
        switch(day){
            case "monday":
            case "tuesday":
            case "wednesday":
            case "thursday":
            case "friday":
                document.write("It is a week day","<br>")
                break;
            case "saturday":
            case "sunday":
                document.write("It is a weekend day","<br>")
                break;
            default:
                document.write("invalid day")                        
        }

Difference between conditional statements and loops :
 conditional statements : block of code which only executes one time if the condition is true
 loops : execute the block of code several times
Question : Electricity bill
Shaik Meera sir asked the students to help calculate the electricity bill for a household. The electricity company charges different rates based on the number of units used. The charges per unit for different ranges are:
• For the first 50 units (0-50): 2 per unit.
• For the next 100 units (51-150): 3 per unit.
• For the next 100 units (151-250): 5 per unit.
• For units above 250 (251 and above): 8 per unit.
After calculating the total charge, an additional 20% of the total amount is added to the bill. Task: Write a program that reads the number of units used and calculates the total electricity bill.
Input:
• The input will be a single number representing the units of electricity used.
Output:
• The output should be the total bill amount, including the additional 20% charge.
// for 200 units -780 bill, for 350 units - 2040 bill
//  for 280 units
50 * 2 = 100
100* 3 = 300
100 * 5 = 500
30* 8 = 240
BILL = 1140
sub charge = 0.2 * 1140 = 228
total = bill + subcharge = 1140+ 228 = 1368
// for 210
50 - 100
100 - 300
60 - 300
 700 * 0.2 = 140
total = 700 + 140 = 840
program :
let units = parseInt(prompt("Enter the number of units used"));
let bill = 0;
if (units <= 50) {
    bill = units * 2;
} else if (units <= 150) {
    bill = 50 * 2 + (units - 50) * 3;
} else if (units <= 250) {
    bill = (50 * 2 )+ 100 * 3 + (units - 150) * 5;
} else {
    bill = (50 * 2) + (100 * 3) + (100 * 5) + (units - 250) * 8;
}

bill = bill + (bill * 20) / 100;
document.write("The total electricity bill is: " + bill);
